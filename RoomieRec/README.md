# RoomieRec
RoomieRec is a project I worked on with another MSAN student for our App Development course. We built a web app using Flask with the goal of helping users find like-minded roommates on Craigslist. The app (currently inactive) was hosted on AWS. In addition to the web app, we used our scraped Craigslist data to create interactive visualizations in R (Shiny).
