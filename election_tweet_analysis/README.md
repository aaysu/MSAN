# election_tweet_analysis
Group project for Data Acquisition (MSAN 692) completed in October, 2016. We used Twitterâ€™s API to gather data on the most recent tweets by users from two groups based on election-related hashtags, and analyzed the content of those tweets to find common patterns. Our analysis for each group included a list of the most commonly linked domains, a histogram of tweet sentiments, average tweet sentiment for specific topics, and creating a word cloud of the most frequent terms found in tweets.
